### Overview
The python program 'scripts.py' will take an excel spreadhseet as input and store all of its data into a pandas DataFrame. The input will contain the following information:
1. Player Names
2. Player's number of weeks attended
3. Player's weekly score
   
We will then use this information to calculate each player's:
1. Average of best 5 weeks
2. Total weekly average
Once these calculations are complete, players will be sorted by their average of their best 5 weeks, and dumped into some visually pleasing document for the league to view.
