# This script will take input in the form of an excel spread sheet containing people and their weekly stats as well as the number of weeks that 
# they have attended. We will store the data into a pandas DataFrame, and calculate the following:
#   1. Average of the players' best 5 weeks.
#   2. The players' weekly average.
# We will then sort all of the players based on their 5-weeks best average, and dump this information into an excel spreadsheet
# or some other format that will be easily readable.
